# Speech Spoofing and Verification

The project contains 3 separate modules that were built using Machine Learning Techniques. 
1. Speaker Recognition: Identifying a speaker's voice from a database of 10 speakers with considerable accuracy.
2. Speech Spoofing: Voice of a source speaker is converted to a target speaker using Recurrent Neural Networks.
3. Speech To Text: Given a speech input, the corresponding text is printed.
